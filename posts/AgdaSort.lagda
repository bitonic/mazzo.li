## Agda?

The Haskell programmer is used to the pleasure of collaborating with a nice type
system.  Haskell itself hits quite a sweet spot of expressivity and
manageability---type inference is (mostly) decidable, no subtyping, etc.
However, in the past 30 years, new systems have been emerging that allow the
user to encode many more properties at the type level.  In fact, these systems
are so expressive that they are often used as logical frameworks for mathematics
rather than to write programs, and are thus often called "theorem provers"
rather than "programming languages."  Thanks to [a notorious
correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry-Howard), we know that these
two activities are really the same.[^itt]

[^itt]: For the interested, the logical core of most of said systems is an
[intensional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_type_theory#Extensional_versus_intensional)
[Intuitionistic Type
Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuitionistic_type_theory).

[Agda](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) is one of the most
prominent systems of this kind at the moment.  Many Haskell programmers like it
because it has very functional slant, doing everything without recurring to
mechanised transformation of terms (of which [Coq](http://coq.inria.fr/) is the
most famous offender).  In this blog I will try to give some examples that will
hopefully make you interested.  This first post explains how sorting algorithms
can be proven correct.  The implementation is largely inspired by a
[presentation](https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/~conor/Pivotal.pdf) by Conor
McBride.

This blog post was generated from a literate Agda file, that you can find
[here](https://github.com/bitonic/website/blob/master/posts/AgdaSort.lagda).
I'm not going to explain how to install Agda here, you can refer to the
[wiki](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php) or the wonderful
[freenode channel](irc://chat.freenode.net/agda).  While I go over all concepts
presented I won't go in depth to keep things reasonably brief: this is intended
to get a taste of what Agda is capable of rather than explaining all its
features.  If you want to read a document meant to be a more comprehensive
introduction, you can refer to the [many
tutorials](http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Othertutorials)
available---personally I recommend Ulf Norell's *Dependently Typed Programming
in Agda*.

Let's get started!

## A few types

### Good old `List`s

\begin{code}
module AgdaSort where
\end{code}

After the module declaration, let's warm up by defining a data type dear to
functional programmers:

\begin{code}
infixr 5 _∷_
data List (X : Set) : Set where
  []  : List X
  _∷_ : X → List X → List X
\end{code}

The syntax to declare this type resembles the syntax for
[GADTs](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/GADT) in Haskell.  Here `X` is the
parametrised type---what Agda calls `Set` is more or less what Haskell calls
`*`, the type of types, or "kind" in Haskell parlance.  `List` is a type
constructor which takes a type and "returns" a new type, `List : Set → Set`,
much like Haskell's `[] :: * → *`.

Then we have two constructors, `[]` for an empty list and `_∷_` to cons an
element to an existing list.  Agda gives us great flexibility in the syntax:
arbitrary operators can defined where `_` indicates an argument, and identifiers
are not limited to the usual mix of alphanumeric characters plus a few of
symbols.  In this case `_∷_` is a binary operator.  The fixity declaration is
similar to what we would find in Haskell.

Let's define `foldr`:

\begin{code}
foldr : ∀ {A} {B : Set} → (A → B → B) → B → List A → B
foldr f b []       = b
foldr f b (a ∷ as) = f a (foldr f b as)
\end{code}

Nothing surprising here, apart from the fact that in the type signature we have
to take the trouble of bringing the type variables into scope manually.  In
Agda, parameters in curly braces are implicit and the type checker will try to
infer them by unification.  This procedure can fail---term inference is
predictably undecidable---in which case the implicits can be explicitly
provided, also with curly braces.  Here we are also omitting the type of the
parameter `A` by using `∀`.  We can do this since `A` appears as an argument to
`List` later in the signature.  For the converse reason we must provide a type
for `B`.

### Sums

Now another "boring" type, `Either`, plus the associated destructor (`either` in
Haskell):

\begin{code}
data Either (A : Set) (B : Set) : Set where
  left  : A → Either A B
  right : B → Either A B

[_,_] : ∀ {A B} {C : Set} → (A → C) → (B → C) → Either A B → C
[ f , g ] (left x)  = f x
[ f , g ] (right x) = g x
\end{code}

### Unhabited types

Now for a type with no inhabitants---no constructors:

\begin{code}
data Empty : Set where
\end{code}

What is `Empty` useful for?  Well, if the user provides a term of type `Empty`,
we can give back anything he might want, corresponding to the logical *ex falso
quodlibet*:

\begin{code}
absurd : {X : Set} → Empty → X
absurd ()
\end{code}

The `()` is what is called an *empty pattern*: Agda knows that no closed term
will be of type `Empty`, and thus lets us leave out the body of functions with
arguments of that type.  Note that in Haskell we can easily get terms of *any*
type in various ways, the most straightforward being general recursion:

    undefined :: forall a. a
    undefined = undefined

Agda makes sure that this is not possible,[^consistent] thus keeping the system
*consistent*.  This has very pleasant consequences, the most prominent being
that all programs terminate.  For this reason consistent systems must be
Turing-incomplete (we can't write an infinite loops!), and thus Agda lets us
step out of these checks if we want to, although it is rarely needed---most
algorithms we write are quite easily provably terminating.  Note that
consistency wasn't put in Agda only to please mathematicians: given the
expressivity of the type system type checking and evaluation are tightly
intertwined, and thus we can send the compiler in an infinite loop if we can
write one.

[^consistent]: Specifically:

    * Functions must be *structurally recursive*, where the arguments in the
      recursive calls are decreasing.
    * Disallows data type declarations that are not *strictly positive*, for
      example the infamous `data Mu f = Mu (f (Mu f))` in Haskell.
    * Has a hierarchy of types---more on this later.

We use `Empty` to define something close to negation in logic:

\begin{code}
infix 3 ¬_
¬_ : Set → Set
¬ X = X → Empty
\end{code}

For example we would expect terms of type `¬ (3 > 4)` to exist.  Here it starts
being clear that types are very first class in Agda; functions can work on
them as they do with ordinary values: in this case `¬` takes a type and forms
another one.

## Different `Rel`ations

We need one last ingredient before we can start sorting.  We *could* write our
sort for some specific data type, say integers, but why would we do that
considering that we have a language that lets us express abstract structures
very naturally?

Instead, we can give a general definition for a binary relation on a type `X`:

\begin{code}
Rel : Set → Set₁
Rel X = X → X → Set
\end{code}

The `Set₁` indicates that a relation between two `Set`s is "larger" than a `Set`
itself---this is nothing to worry about now, but it follows a tradition in set
theory that goes back to Russell to avoid paradoxes.[^girards]  `Set` is in fact
a shorthand for `Set₀` and represents the type of types of values: `Empty : Set₀
: Set₁ : Set₂ : ...`.

[^girards]: In type theory this is known as Girards' paradox, you can find an
Agda (with `Set : Set` enabled) rendition
[here](http://code.haskell.org/Agda/test/succeed/Hurkens.agda).

Then we define the type of decidable relations---we would expect relations like
"less than" on natural numbers or "sortedness" on lists to be decidable:

\begin{code}
Decidable : ∀ {X} → Rel X → Set
Decidable R = ∀ x y → Either (R x y) (¬ (R x y))
\end{code}

That is, a decidable relation has a function that tells us if any `x` and `y`
are related or not.

Now the interesting part.  To sort a list, we need two relations on the elements
of the list: some notion of equality and some ordering on the elements (in fact
the latter requires the former).  More formally, the equality will be an
[equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation).  To
express abstract properties over types we can use a record, much like type
classes are used in Haskell---only more flexible but without the big advantage
of having automatic instance resolution:

\begin{code}
record Equivalence {X} (_≈_ : Rel X) : Set₁ where
  field
    refl  : ∀ {x}     → x ≈ x
    sym   : ∀ {x y}   → x ≈ y → y ≈ x
    trans : ∀ {x y z} → x ≈ y → y ≈ z → x ≈ z
\end{code}

The definition on Wikipedia translates literally to Agda.  Same story for our
ordering, which will need to be
[total](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_ordering):

\begin{code}
record TotalOrder {X} (_≈_ : Rel X) (_≤_ : Rel X) : Set₁ where
  field
    antisym     : ∀ {x y}   → x ≤ y → y ≤ x → x ≈ y
    trans       : ∀ {x y z} → x ≤ y → y ≤ z → x ≤ z
    total       : ∀ x y     → Either (x ≤ y) (y ≤ x)
    reflexive   : ∀ {x y}   → x ≈ y → x ≤ y
    equivalence : Equivalence _≈_
\end{code}

## Sorting

We can finally begin to sort.  To do this we will define a module parametrised
over a type and an ordering.  Agda has a very flexible module system---in fact
we have already been using it by defining records, which are implicitly modules.

\begin{code}
module Sort {X} {_≈_ _≤_ : Rel X}
            (_≤?_ : Decidable _≤_) (ord : TotalOrder _≈_ _≤_) where
  open TotalOrder ord using (total; equivalence)
  open Equivalence equivalence using (refl)
\end{code}

We require the ordering relation to be decidable, and we bring in scope some
fields of the records using `open`, so that we can use them directly.

### Insertion sort

We want to represent bounded lists, but we also want the bounds to be possibly
open.  For this purpose we lift our type `X` in a data type that contains a
top and bottom elements, that are respectively greater or equal and lower or
equal than all the other elements.

\begin{code}
  data ⊥X⊤ : Set where
    ⊤ ⊥ : ⊥X⊤
    ⟦_⟧ : X → ⊥X⊤
\end{code}

For `⊥X⊤` to be useful, we lift our ordering to work with it, following our
considerations about the top and bottom elements:

\begin{code}
  data _≤̂_ : Rel ⊥X⊤ where
    ⊥≤̂     : ∀ {x} → ⊥ ≤̂ x
    ≤̂⊤     : ∀ {x} → x ≤̂ ⊤
    ≤-lift : ∀ {x y} → x ≤ y → ⟦ x ⟧ ≤̂ ⟦ y ⟧
\end{code}

Note that this data type is different from what we have defined before: the
parameters to the type constructor can vary between data constructors---much
like in GADTs in Haskell.  In Agda, "changing" (more formally "non linear")
parameters are known as *indices*, as opposed to non-changing *parameters*.
Parameters are named and to the left of the colon, while the type to the right
of the colon will determine the number and type of indices---in this case two
`⊥X⊤`s (remember, `Rel ⊥X⊤ = ⊥X⊤ → ⊥X⊤ → Set`).  This kind of data type is known
as *inductive family*.[^indices]

[^indices]: Some might ask why Agda doesn't treat all parameters uniformly,
simply allowing indices at will.  This is definitely an option (taken by other
programming languages, and GHC's GADTs) but separating them brings more clarity
in the interface and lets Agda deal with inductive families more
straightforwardly.

We can now define the type of bounded, ordered lists:

\begin{code}
  data OList (l u : ⊥X⊤) : Set where
    nil  : l ≤̂ u → OList l u
    cons : ∀ x (xs : OList ⟦ x ⟧ u) → l ≤̂ ⟦ x ⟧ → OList l u
\end{code}

`nil` will work with any bounds, provided that the lower `l` is less or equal
than the upper `u`.  `cons` will cons an element `x` to a list with `x` as a
lower bound, and return a list with lower bound `l`, provided that `l ≤̂ ⟦ x ⟧`.
It's clear from how `cons` work that the elements in `OList` will be ordered
according to the `≤` relation.

We can easily get a plain list back from an `OList`:

\begin{code}
  toList : ∀ {l u} → OList l u → List X
  toList (nil _)       = []
  toList (cons x xs _) = x ∷ toList xs
\end{code}

With the right data types, writing and proving correct[^sortcorrect] an
[insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort) is a breeze---I
encourage you to try and writing yourself checking the goals as you pattern
match, the only non-trivial case being the last one:

[^sortcorrect]: Some might rightfully complain that actually we are only proving
half of the story, since we need to guarantee that the result list is a
permutation of the input list to prove a sorting algorithm correct.  That is
doable but a bit more involved.

\begin{code}
  insert : ∀ {l u} x → OList l u → l ≤̂ ⟦ x ⟧ → ⟦ x ⟧ ≤̂ u → OList l u
  insert y (nil _)         l≤y y≤u = cons y (nil y≤u) l≤y
  insert y (cons x xs l≤x) l≤y y≤u with y ≤? x
  insert y (cons x xs l≤x) l≤y y≤u | left  y≤x = cons y (cons x xs (≤-lift y≤x)) l≤y
  insert y (cons x xs l≤x) l≤y y≤u | right y>x =
    cons x (insert y xs ([ ≤-lift , (λ y≤x → absurd (y>x y≤x)) ] (total x y)) y≤u) l≤x
\end{code}

Insertion sort is just a fold, where we use the type `OList ⊥ ⊤` to represent a
sorted list with open bounds:

\begin{code}
  isort′ : List X → OList ⊥ ⊤
  isort′ = foldr (λ x xs → insert x xs ⊥≤̂ ≤̂⊤) (nil ⊥≤̂)

  isort : List X → List X
  isort xs = toList (isort′ xs)
\end{code}

### Tree sort

Now for something more efficient, a [tree
sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_sort).  Firstly we'll define a bounded,
ordered binary tree:

\begin{code}
  data Tree (l u : ⊥X⊤) : Set where
    leaf : l ≤̂ u → Tree l u
    node : (x : X) → Tree l ⟦ x ⟧ → Tree ⟦ x ⟧ u → Tree l u
\end{code}

The technique is similar to that employed in `OList`.  Then we need a procedure
to insert an element in an existing tree:

\begin{code}
  newLeaf : ∀ {l u} → (x : X) → Tree l u → l ≤̂ ⟦ x ⟧ → ⟦ x ⟧ ≤̂ u → Tree l u
  newLeaf x (leaf _)       l≤x x≤u = node x (leaf l≤x) (leaf x≤u)
  newLeaf x (node y ly yu) l≤x x≤u with x ≤? y
  newLeaf x (node y ly yu) l≤x x≤u | left x≤y  =
    node y (newLeaf x ly l≤x (≤-lift x≤y)) yu
  newLeaf x (node y ly yu) l≤x x≤u | right x>y =
    node y ly (newLeaf x yu ([ (λ x≤y → absurd (x>y x≤y)) , ≤-lift ] (total x y)) x≤u)
\end{code}

Again, the only tricky bit is the last one, where we need to convince Agda that
`y ≤ x` given that `¬ (x ≤ y)`.

Similar to `isort′`, turning a `List` into a `Tree` is a simple fold:

\begin{code}
  fromList : List X → Tree ⊥ ⊤
  fromList = foldr (λ x xs → newLeaf x xs ⊥≤̂ ≤̂⊤) (leaf ⊥≤̂)
\end{code}

Now we can define `OList` concatenation, with the twist of inserting a new
element in the middle; and finally `flatten`:

\begin{code}
  _⇒_++_ : ∀ {l u} x → OList l ⟦ x ⟧ → OList ⟦ x ⟧ u → OList l u
  x ⇒ nil l≤u       ++ xu = cons x xu l≤u
  x ⇒ cons y yx l≤y ++ xu = cons y (x ⇒ yx ++ xu) l≤y

  flatten : ∀ {l u} → Tree l u → OList l u
  flatten (leaf l≤u)     = (nil l≤u)
  flatten (node x lx xu) = x ⇒ flatten lx ++ flatten xu
\end{code}

Then we are good with yet another fold.

\begin{code}
  treeSort′ : List X → OList ⊥ ⊤
  treeSort′ xs = flatten (foldr (λ x xs → newLeaf x xs ⊥≤̂ ≤̂⊤) (leaf ⊥≤̂) xs)

  treeSort : List X → List X
  treeSort xs = toList (treeSort′ xs)
\end{code}

## Propositional equality

Now lets put our module to work.  We will need a type equipped with the
appropriate relations: in this post I am going to use natural numbers.

For what concerns equality, we can actually define an inductive family that
relates equal terms:

\begin{code}
module PropositionalEquality where
  data _≡_ {X} : Rel X where
    refl : ∀ {x} → x ≡ x
\end{code}

It's worth mentioning what equal means here.  I have mentioned earlier that
"evaluation and typechecking are intertwined": when the type checker has to
decide if two types, or more generally two terms, are "the same", it simply
reduces them as far as possible (to their *normal form*) and then compares
them syntactically, plus some additional laws.[^etalaws]  Remember, every Agda
term is terminating, so this procedure itself is guaranteed to terminate.
Thus, `refl : ((λ x → x) 1) ≡ 1` is acceptable, and so on.

[^etalaws]: For example partial applications are expanded, so that if `f : A ->
B`, then `f ≡ λ x → f x`.  Similary, if we have a record `Tuple (A B : Set) :
Set` with fields `fst : A` and `snd : B`, and constructor `_,_`; if `x : Tuple A
B` then `x ≡ fst x , snd x`.  Apart from these *η laws*, other additions can be
made to have more terms deemed as equal by the type checker, details vary from
system to system.

This notion of equality is often called *definitional equality*, as opposed to
the user-level equality expressed by the inductive family we have just defined,
which takes the name of *propositional equality*.  Note that having a
prop. equality in scope *does not* imply definitional equality for the related
terms, unless the prop. equality is a closed term.[^setoid]  In the general case
we might have prop. equalities in scope that do not necessarily hold or involve
abstracted variables, think of `λ (p : 3 ≡ 1) → ...`.

[^setoid]: This is the reason why we did not just use `≡` from the beginning and
we instead chose to parametrise our equality relation: sometimes propositional
equality does not cut it, for example when working with functions.

Let's prove that `≡` is an equivalence relation, and a `cong`ruence law which
will be useful later:

\begin{code}
  sym : ∀ {X} {x y : X} → x ≡ y → y ≡ x
  sym refl = refl

  trans : ∀ {X} {x y z : X} → x ≡ y → y ≡ z → x ≡ z
  trans refl refl = refl

  equivalence : ∀ {X} → Equivalence {X} _≡_
  equivalence = record { refl = refl; sym = sym; trans = trans }

  cong : ∀ {X} {x y : X} → (f : X → X) → x ≡ y → f x ≡ f y
  cong _ refl = refl
\end{code}

Here we use pattern matching in a new way: since the value of the indices of `≡`
depends on the constructors, matching on a constructor refines the context with
the new information.  For example in `sym` pattern matching `refl` will unify
`y` and `x`, turning them into the same variable in the context for the body of
`sym`, and thus letting us invoke `refl` again.  Pattern matching is a much more
powerful notion in Agda that is in in most (even dependently typed) programming
languages---it can not only change the context, but it will also constraint the
possible constructors of other parameters, if they are of a type with indices
and those indices have been refined.  This collection of techniques is known as
*dependent pattern matching*.

## Natural numbers

\begin{code}
module Nat where
  data ℕ : Set where
    zero : ℕ
    suc  : ℕ → ℕ

  {-# BUILTIN NATURAL ℕ    #-}
\end{code}

The definition for naturals is the usual one---the pragmas are there so that we
can use number literals.

Now for our ordering relation.  Every number is greater or equal than zero, and
if `x ≤ y` then `x + 1 ≤ y + 1`:

\begin{code}
  data _≤_ : Rel ℕ where
    z≤n : ∀ {x}   → zero ≤ x
    s≤s : ∀ {x y} → x ≤ y → suc x ≤ suc y
\end{code}

With the help of the dual of `s≤s`, we can write our decision function for `≤`:

\begin{code}
  ≤-suc : ∀ {x y} → suc x ≤ suc y → x ≤ y
  ≤-suc (s≤s x≤y) = x≤y

  _≤?_ : Decidable _≤_
  zero  ≤? _     = left z≤n
  suc _ ≤? zero  = right λ()
  suc x ≤? suc y with x ≤? y
  ... | left x≤y  = left  (s≤s x≤y)
  ... | right x>y = right (λ sx≤sy → x>y (≤-suc sx≤sy))
\end{code}

And the required laws to make a total order out of `≤`:

\begin{code}
  open PropositionalEquality using (_≡_; refl; cong; equivalence)

  antisym : ∀ {x y} → x ≤ y → y ≤ x → x ≡ y
  antisym z≤n       z≤n       = refl
  antisym (s≤s x≤y) (s≤s y≤x) = cong suc (antisym x≤y y≤x)

  trans : ∀ {x y z} → x ≤ y → y ≤ z → x ≤ z
  trans z≤n       _         = z≤n
  trans (s≤s x≤y) (s≤s y≤z) = s≤s (trans x≤y y≤z)

  total : ∀ x y → Either (x ≤ y) (y ≤ x)
  total zero    _       = left  z≤n
  total (suc x) zero    = right z≤n
  total (suc x) (suc y) with total x y
  ... | left  x≤y = left  (s≤s x≤y)
  ... | right y≤x = right (s≤s y≤x)

  reflexive : ∀ {x y} → x ≡ y → x ≤ y
  reflexive {zero}  refl = z≤n
  reflexive {suc _} refl = s≤s (reflexive refl)

  totalOrder : TotalOrder _≡_ _≤_
  totalOrder = record
    { antisym     = antisym
    ; trans       = trans
    ; total       = total
    ; reflexive   = reflexive
    ; equivalence = equivalence
    }
\end{code}

Finally, we can import the sorting functions.  We're done!

\begin{code}
  open Sort _≤?_ totalOrder using (isort; treeSort)
\end{code}

We can test our function:

\begin{code}
  willIBeSorted? : List ℕ
  willIBeSorted? = treeSort (12 ∷ 3 ∷ 7 ∷ 4 ∷ 40 ∷ 5 ∷ 0 ∷ [])
\end{code}

A tap on `C-c C-n willIBeSorted?` will give the expected result:

```{.sourceCode}
0 ∷ 3 ∷ 4 ∷ 5 ∷ 7 ∷ 12 ∷ 40 ∷ []
```
